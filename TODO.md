## Things to do

Many things, but particularly urgent are:

1. Use physical units for distances and time

2. Better comments in the code

3. Better centering of axis labels, and particularly X axis labels

4. If animation gets slow, the red dots indicating the nodes can be off (because they are plotted at the next clock tick). Fix by interpolating to the node time.
